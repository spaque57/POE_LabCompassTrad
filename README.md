# Path Of Exile LabCompass translator
Script created by spaque for Path of Exile french fans to tranlsate JSON lab files from www.poelab.com and use LabCompass in the french version of POE.


# ALPHA VERSION
THIS VERSION should not work with LabCompass because area names are not good.

You need an dictionnary file with translation of area names, like (tab separated): basilica'\t'basilique 
You need a lab file in JSON format from poelab.com
Run script: ./LabCompass_trad.pl dictionnary.txt merciless-2019-01-08.json output_name

Script should translate word by word the name of the area.
